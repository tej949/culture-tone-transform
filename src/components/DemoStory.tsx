            I was constantly being rejected after job interviews because of what recruiters called my "tone issues" in follow-up emails. As a Colombian developer applying to international companies, I didn't understand what I was doing wrong. After using the Cultural Email Transformer for just two weeks, everything changed. My emails were clear, professional, and culturally appropriate. I secured three job offers in one month! This tool didn't just transform my emailsâ€”it transformed my career.
